### Rocketnani
Coded in C, launches a rocket on your terminal when you run it!

Code might appear to be piles of spaghetti bullshit. Works perfectly on MacOS, if it doesn't work on linux then either tell me to fix it or fork it.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/mnk400/rocketnani.git
$ cd rocketnani
$ make install
```

to uninstall
```sh
$ make uninstall
```
